        <p>We'll have a super time. What the devil. It looks so good, I might as well not stop. Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner. Let's have a little bit of fun today. We must be quiet, soft
          and gentle. Put it in, leave it alone. The least little bit can do so much. See there how easy that is. But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it. Follow the lay of the land. It's most important. Use what you see, don't plan
          it. Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one.</p>

        <p>Just a happy little shadow that lives in there. We can always carry this a step further. There's really no end to this. This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart. Water's
          like me. It's laaazyÂ ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things. Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and it is up to you to make friends with the little
          rascals. Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart.</p>

      <p>It just happens - whether or not you worried about it or tried to plan it. Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. In your world you can create anything you desire. Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy. I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow.</p>
